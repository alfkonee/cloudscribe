    /// views in higher folders will be found first.

    /// Since this is instantiated in Startup it may not be possible to do that
    /// however we might want to look into the Orchard project ThemeAwareViewEngine.cs
    /// they seem to be pulling in views from theme specific folders and not using the normal mvc conventions
    /// I think we should try not to deviate far from normal mvc conventions, ie views should still be below the Views folder
